# The Wandering Murderer
***

A terrifying new mob that will hunt you down in seek of revenge. It will only spawn after killing a wandering trader. Reminds me of some terraria boss spawning mechanics.
This is meant to be a unique take on the horror Minecraft niche. The initial goal was to make it so that it wouldn't have a weakness to the typical horror mob thing like pillaring or swimming, but also make it logically make sense. 
For a while I've wanted to make a mob that was in the horror-ish genre, but also stand out.

If you manage to survive its onslaught, you will receive the Gilded Emerald Cleaver, and gain its respect.

# Milkman's Weapon: Reborn
***

This was initially meant to be something terrifying hidden within another datapack, so there is indeed another bit of content associated with this. 
Crafting has been given a small overhaul, where you can now also use the top of the crafting table to craft things!

- Right click slots to add items
- Left click slots to remove
- Left click another part on the top of the crafting table to craft



This portion introduces two new items:
The Molotov Milktail, and the Milktail Crate.

The Molotov Milktail can be crafted through using:
- Milk Bucket
- TNT
- Any wool carpet
- Glass Bottle

The max stack size is 3.

The Milktail Craft can be crafting through using:
- 2 Raw copper
- Any wool block
- Lead
The raw copper must be placed in the bottom two corners, and the wool inbetween. Then the lead is placed directly above the wool.




# WARNING
The mod may lead to everything appearing as emeralds, ender pearls, etc. So it is recommended that you also use the resource pack alongside the mod.
