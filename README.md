# The Wandering Murderer
***

A terrifying new mob that will hunt you down in seek of revenge. It will only spawn after killing a wandering trader. Reminds me of some terraria boss spawning mechanics.
This is meant to be a unique take on the horror Minecraft niche. The initial goal was to make it so that it wouldn't have a weakness to the typical horror mob thing like pillaring or swimming, but also make it logically make sense. 
For a while I've wanted to make a mob that was in the horror-ish genre, but also stand out.
Now it's a boss fight instead loll

If you manage to survive and defeat it, you will receive the Gilded Emerald Cleaver, and gain its respect.

# Milkman's Weapon: Reborn
***

This was initially meant to be something terrifying hidden within another datapack, so there is indeed another bit of content associated with this. 

The Molotov Milktail, and the Milktail Crate.

The Molotov Milktail can be crafted through using:
- Milk Bucket
- TNT

The max stack size is 16.

The Milktail Crate can be crafting through using:
- 2 Raw copper
- Any wool block
- Stick
The raw copper must be placed in the bottom two corners, and the wool inbetween. Then the stick is placed directly above the wool.




# WARNING
The mod may lead to everything appearing as emeralds, ender pearls, etc. So it is recommended that you also use the resource pack alongside the mod.
The mod only exists for legacy releases.
